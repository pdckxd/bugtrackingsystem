Dynamic Programming
The first feature in C# 4.0 is the support to dynamic programming. 
A new keyword is introduced: dynamic and it's used to tell the compiler that the object is defined at runtime, 
and it's able to response to dynamic messages. A dynamic object is assumed to support any operation 
at compile time; only at runtime you will get an error.
